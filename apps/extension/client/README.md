## Hints and Tips

### Ignoring machines

If you'd like to ignore linting/autocomplete on a machine, add a `// xstate-ignore-next-line` comment on the line above it:

```ts
// xstate-ignore-next-line
createMachine({});
```

### Refactors

Click the lightbulb when hovering an named action, guard or service in a machine to see available refactors.
